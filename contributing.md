#Contributing Guidelines for PatManPlus

Firstly thank you so much for considering to contribute on this project. Before you do so can you please ensure you read through these guidelines so that you understand the situation around the problem at hand.


##Restrictions of a Hospital

Obviously there are various restrictions in place within hospitals in terms of security and the ability to install and access software. Please be aware of this, read through the detail within <a href="The Ward Round.md">The Ward Round</a> to fully understand the current problem. Also note it is not always possible to install new software on hospital servers. The system needs to be accessible on a shared network drive but accessible through a simple interface. This is why the approach has been taken to produce an _exe_ file that can be accessed through the network drives in a hospital. Note that the system will be standalone for each ward that wishes to use it. There is no need have them talk to each other.
