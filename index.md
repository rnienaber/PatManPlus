# Next-Gen Patient Lists

Welcome to the next-generation patient list manager PatManPlus.

This will change the life of every junior doctor in the NHS.

### Purpose
The software is designed to allow junior doctors to manage their patient lists to provide an efficient way to complete a ward round and also manage the various jobs assigned to that ward. It replaces more archaic systems currently in place. Such as word documents, spreadsheets, MS Access databases and paper based alternatives. To find out more about the way this is managed see <a href= "The Ward Round.md">The Ward Round</a>

### MVP
An MVP has been developed to allow replication of the current system. There are further features and improvements that have been identified within *issues*.

### Technology
PatManPlus is a program that will be stored on the network drive of a hospital, it is accessed using an _exe_ file. It has been created using Electron, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and SQLite. This allows it to be serverless which is one of the main requirements.
