Welcome to the next-generation patient list manager.

This will change the life of every junior doctor in the NHS.

The software is designed to allow junior doctors to manage their patient lists to provide an efficient way to complete a ward round and thus also manage the various jobs assigned to that ward. Each morning junior doctors are required to conduct a ward round to a number of patients. Often this number is above 50. In many hospitals there are inefficient methods to control the process. This is often managed using several word documents or poorly controlled spreadsheets that results in many inconsistent versions floating around on a shared network drive. This means that time is wasted in locating patients and understanding who to go to as a priority.

A simple Access DB was developed by Vishnu, a consultant, to improve the current methods within his ward at the time. This had a positive impact on the efficiency of doctors and consultants. It is currently in use in a small number of departments across various hospitals that Vishnu has worked in. Often doctors and consultants who experience the use of this database want to copy it to take on to their next post. However there are issues with the transferability of this system to other departments and hospitals. This arises from a lack of MS Access on every computer in a hospital and the ability of doctors and consultants in using a system based upon MS Access. The system is also

A new MVP has been developed to allow replication of the current system. There are further features and improvements that have been identified that can be accessed through the trello board for the project.
